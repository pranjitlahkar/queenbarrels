  content: "Matured in handpicked bourbon casks, our Indian malt rests for five years before being artfully blended with the finest Indian grain spirit. The result is a whiskey of rare characterâ€”smooth, elegant, and layered with depth. On the nose, it greets you with woody and smoky notes, while on the palate it unfolds with luxurious smoothness, subtle warmth, and a lingering smoky finish. A perfect balance of approachability and distinction, Queen's Crown embodies both tradition and modern refinement. It is our way of sharing the richness of true whiskey with those who value authenticity, craftsmanship, and timeless taste.",
